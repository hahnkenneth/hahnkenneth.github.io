Speaking of travelling, I am also an avid traveller. I've always tried to travel to a new country every year and am in love with trying out new foods and gaining new experiences!

I've visited many of the countries within Europe now and I've set my sights to visit some of the most popular countries in Asia! With Korea knocked off the list, my next journey will be in Japan where I'll be staying there for a month to see the sights and solo-travel for my first time.
