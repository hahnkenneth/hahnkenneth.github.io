Hello! I'm Kenneth Hahn, a Chemical Engineer turned Aspiring Data Scientist. Welcome to my Portfolio!

I graduated from U.C. Berkeley in 2020 with a degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Mechanical Engineering. Since then, I’ve been working in the manufacturing industry as a Process Engineer, where I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to the production of battery packs for Tesla vehicles and high-chained fatty alcohols for Procter & Gamble—the precursors to many of your favorite soap products!

My experience in manufacturing has nurtured my curiosity and passion for problem-solving. I’ve tackled critical questions like, "How does a 1% increase in throughput affect a valve's feedback control?" and "How can we reduce the cost per carset needed to manufacture a battery pack by $5/carset?" These questions are vital to any business, and what I’ve learned is that finding answers requires reliable data collection and thorough analysis.

This realization has led me down the path to becoming a Data Scientist. I am driven by a desire to answer complex questions and to understand the data and statistics that fuel meaningful change. My engineering background equips me with a unique perspective, enabling me to approach problems creatively and effectively.

Currently, I am furthering my education by pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at U.C. Berkeley. I’m excited to combine my engineering experience with advanced data science skills to solve real-world problems.

Feel free to explore my projects and other experiences on this site. I’m always open to connecting and discussing how data can drive innovation. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
