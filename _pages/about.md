Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Kenneth Hahn and I'm a chemical engineer turned aspiring data scientist. Since I graduated from U.C. Berkeley in 2020 with an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering and a minor in mechanical engineering, I have worked in the manufacturing industry as a Process Engineer, producing battery packs for Tesla vehicles and high chained fatty alcohols for Procter & Gamble (the precursor to all your favorite soap products!).

Working in manufacturing has helped develop my curiousity in asking and answering questions. Questions such as "how does a 1% increase in throughput affect a valve's feedback control?" or "How do we reduce the cost per carset needed to manufacture a battery pack by $5/carset?" are critical toward the functionality of any business. And what I've realized from delving into these questions is that the journey to get to the answer relies on the reliable collection and analysis of data.

So that's what has led me down this path of becoming a data scientist. I strive to answer questions and understand the statistics and data that drive change. My unique engineering background allows me to visualize problems from a fresh persepective that I hope to solve using my manufacturing experience and my current re-enrollment at U.C. Berkeley, this time pursuing a Master's in Data Science. Please explore my projects and my other experiences on this page and I am always available to help answer any questions!
