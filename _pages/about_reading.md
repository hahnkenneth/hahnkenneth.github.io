During the rest of my free time, I've recently started reading quite a lot! I'm mainly into the Science Fiction and Fantasy genres, with my favorite books being anything written by Brandon Sanderson, especially the [Stormlight Archives](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings) , or the [Sword of Kaigen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41886271-the-sword-of-kaigen?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2FawIZBFa8&rank=1) by M.L. Wang. I'm always looking for new recommendations and this definitely has been a good way to avoid doom-scrolling on my phone!
