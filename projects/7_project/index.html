We chose this project due to the increasing popularity of space travel after SpaceX’s successful catch of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/science/starship-test-flight-6-launch-spacex/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Super Heavy Rocket</a>. The goal of the project was to be able to classify whether a object in space was considered as an exoplanet or not. With the amount of data and measurements taken, we hoped to be able to expedite the process for astronomists.</p> <p>Our data consisted of 9576 objects of interest (these are referenced as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi</code> or Kepler Objects of Interest) with 49 different features that included things like the object’s transit properties, star parameters, and parameters on the crossing event. I began by creating a correlation heatmap. Initially, I removed many of the features that had to do with identification of the object or features that were archived or leaked information on whether the object was an exoplanet or not (leading to 13 dropped columns). Our target variable was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_pdisposition</code> column, which was a binary column of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CANDIDATE</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FALSE POSITIVE</code> on whether the object was an exoplanet or not. This was then binary encoded for use in the model later. For the remaining features, we split the dataset into train, test, and validation sets for later use.</p> <h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis-and-feature-engineering">Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering</h2> <p>The first observation I made was that many of the features has error columns which had the positive and negative errors of that feature’s measurement. However, these error columns had perfect correlation with the measurements themselves due to the fact that error increases proportionally with any measurement taken. Therefore, to remove collinearity and redundancy of features, I dropped all of the columns. The reduced heatmap is shown below, now with 16 measurement features.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/initial_correlation_heatmap-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/initial_correlation_heatmap-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/initial_correlation_heatmap-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/initial_correlation_heatmap.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="graph layout" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Initial Correlation Heatmap after removing Error features </div> <p>Next we reviewed the pairplot between all features. Due to the sheer number of features remaining, I split the features into different categories: Stellar Parameters (features on the star that the object orbits around), Threshold Crossing Event features (a.k.a. TCE, which is the event when the planet blocks some amount of light from the star that is detectable and marks an object of interest), and Transit Properties (or the properties about the object and its orbit). The below pairplot shows all the features belonging to the transit properties of the objects.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/initial_pairplot-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/initial_pairplot-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/initial_pairplot-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/initial_pairplot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="graph layout" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Initial Pairplot on the Transit Properties of the Object of Interest. </div> <p>From the pairplot I observed that most of the histograms along the diagonal showed that nearly all of the features were heavily right skewed (some were so skewed that I couldn’t even see it on the histogram). Also another observation was that there were several features that showed some form of logarithmic relationship between them, as seen from the scatterplot between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_insol</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_teq</code>. Both of these observations meant that I should transform these numeric features to better capture relationships as well as to reduce the effect of outliers. As a result, I log-transformed all of the numeric variables. The only one where I did not transform was the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_tce_plnt_num</code>, as this was a label_encoded value from 1-8. The planet number will be one hot encoded later.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># copy all of the data sets for log transformations

</code></pre></div></div> <p>From here, I replotted the heatmap with the log transformed values along with the pairplot. As seen from the pairplot most of the distributions were now more visible and some of the features had a more normal distribution. Also, after log transformation, we see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_teq</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_insol</code> were now nearly linear after log transforming all the features. This is further emphasized in the correlation heatmap, which shows that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_teq</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_insol</code> have a 1.0 correlation with one another. Investigating these two variables further, the NASA data dictionary does state that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_teq</code> is the equilibrium temperature of the object while the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_insol</code> is the insolation flux, or the radiation heatflux of the object. This makes sense as the heat flux caused by radiation is proprotional to the Temperature to the fourth power (q ⍺ T<sup>4</sup>). As a result, when we log transformed both variables, we get a perfectly linear relationship.</p> <p>The same goes for the -0.99 corrleation between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_slogg</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_srad</code>, which is the gravitational acceleration and the radius of the star, respectively. The gravitational acceleration is inversely proportional to the radius of the star squared (g ⍺ r<sup>-2</sup>), which is why we see the negative correlation after log transformation. As a result of these findings, we removed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_srad</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_insol</code> to avoid redundancy between variables.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/log_transformed_pairplot-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/log_transformed_pairplot-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/log_transformed_pairplot-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/log_transformed_pairplot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="graph layout" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Pairplot of Stellar Parameters after log transformations. </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/log_transformed_heatmap-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/log_transformed_heatmap-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/log_transformed_heatmap-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/log_transformed_heatmap.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="graph layout" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Correlation Heatmap after log transformations (this does not include all the features in order to emphasize the most important correlations). </div> <p>For a final observation, I saw that after log transformations, there were several features that had bimodal distributions after separating by classes. For each of these, we attempted to bin the features in order to separate the peaks and allow for easier classification; however, we observed from modelling, that it ended up reducing our overall accuracy of all of our models. This could be due to the fact that we are over simplifying the relationship. As a result, the manual binning process is displayed in the code, but we did not end up using this bit of feature engineering.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bimodal_dist-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bimodal_dist-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bimodal_dist-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/bimodal_dist.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="graph layout" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Distributions of two features that display bimodal distributions when colored by target classes. Also, the red line indicates the attempted bin boundary that we manually set from observation. </div> <p>Some final preprocessing with the data was that we used a RobustScalar to standardize the data. We used a RobustScalar in order to scale outliers better, since even with the log transformations, we still observed some outliers in some of our features. As for missing values, we ended up dropping missing values which consisted of 4%, 3$, and 2% in our train, validation, and test datasets respectively. Due to the low percentage, we assumed that we’d have enough data for modelling. Also, we had two categorical variables (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_tce_plnt_num</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">koi_tce_delivname</code>) which had eight and three categories, respectively. This led us to one hot encoding these two columns. In conclusion, we ended up with 8945 rows and 24 total features.</p> <h2 id="baseline-models">Baseline Models</h2> <p>We ran two different baseline models in order to compare our final model to.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Both of these accuracies did pretty well for the simplicity of implementation. We ultimately decided to see if a neural network improved upon these two baselines.</p> <h2 id="final-model">Final Model</h2> <p>We ultimately chose to do a neural network to better capture the nonlinear relationships and be able to optimize the hyperparameters. Also our training dataset is ~5000 datapoints; however, with more data we could find online, we may be able to improve the training on this model over time. As a result, after trial and error, we ultimately ended up with a feed forward neural network with one input layer, three hidden layers with ReLU activation, two dropout layers (with dropout rate = 0.3), and an output layer with softmax activation. Other hyperparameters included a 0.00001 learning rate, Adam optimizer, 32 batch size, and 1000 epochs with EarlyStopping callback (patience of 10 epochs).</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/model_summary-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/model_summary-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/model_summary-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/model_summary.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="graph layout" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Neural Network Model Summary. </div> <p>This final model ultimately resulted in a 84.2% validation accuracy, which we were satisfied with for the purposes of this project.

It can be argued that the neural network is comparable to the random forest model (with a difference in accuracy of 0.7%) to which I agree and we can ultimately choose either model for our final result. We again decided to go with the neural network to gain a better understanding with TensorFlow and potentially improve it further with more understanding of the features (as we are not experts in this field).</p> <h2 id="model-evaluation">Model Evaluation</h2> <p>For our final evaluation, we used the test dataset to measure the metrics of accuracy, precision, and recall. The test dataset had an accuracy of 83.7%, which displayed that our model had relatively good generalization properties and could handle new data well. Also our F1-scores for False Positives and Candidate classifications was 84% and 83%, respectively, which once again showed that we were pretty balanced in the classification of both classes.d</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/original_confusion_matrix-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/original_confusion_matrix-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/original_confusion_matrix-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/original_confusion_matrix.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="graph layout" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Confusion Matrix on test data </div> <p>Going back to the original goal, our task was to expedite the process of exoplanet classification; however, I thought that mislabeling the Candidate class as a False Positive class would lead to a much more serious impact, since then astronomists would have to rereview the candidate and false positive classes. As a result, we decided to decrease the decision threshold (from an initial threshold to 0.5). While this would make the Candidate class accuracy worse, it would ultimately improve our False Positive Accuracy and prevent misclassification of potential exoplanets getting scrapped into the False Positive Bin.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Metric</th> <th>Threshold=0.5</th> <th>Threshold=0.35</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Accuracy</td> <td>0.84</td> <td>0.81</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Candidate Precision</td> <td>0.82</td> <td>0.75</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Candidate Recall</td> <td>0.82</td> <td>0.91</td> </tr> <tr> <td>False Positive Precision</td> <td>0.83</td> <td>0.89</td> </tr> <tr> <td>False Positive Recall</td> <td>0.83</td> <td>0.71</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>As seen from the table above, we decided on a threshold of 0.35, where it would lead to a 3% decrease in our overall accuracy, but it would improve our Candidate Recall and False Positive Precision to 91% and 89% respectively.
